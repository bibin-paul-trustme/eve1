Subject: [PATCH] tpm: fix potential NULL pointer access in tpm_del_char_device

Some SPI controller drivers unregister the controller in the shutdown
handler (e.g. BCM2835). If such a controller is used with a TPM 2 slave
chip->ops may be accessed when it is already NULL:

At system shutdown the pre-shutdown handler tpm_class_shutdown() shuts down
TPM 2 and sets chip->ops to NULL. Then at SPI controller unregistration
tpm_tis_spi_remove() is called and eventually calls tpm_del_char_device()
which tries to shut down TPM 2 again. Thereby it accesses chip->ops again:
(tpm_del_char_device calls tpm_chip_start which calls tpm_clk_enable which
calls chip->ops->clk_enable).

Avoid the NULL pointer access by testing if chip->ops is valid and skipping
the TPM 2 shutdown procedure in case it is NULL.
