# ZFS (highly experimental support)

ZFS provides a rich set of functionality but at a cost of extra
resource usage. Currently ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache) size is
limited to `min(256 MiB + 0.3% of total zpool size, 20% of system RAM)` but at least 384
MiB. Keep in mind that this memory will be taken out form the
applications.

If system does not have enough memory to satisfy the limit mentioned
above, severe performance degradation can occur on random access
workflows.

## Performance tunings applied

`primarycache=metadata` - allows to keep arc cache size low. The primary
use-case of zfs is zvol attached to a VM. And VM already does cache
it's data, furthermore it knows better what to cache.

`recordsize=16k` - is a sweet spot between constantly having sub-blocks
updates, and good compression ratio.

`compression=zstd` - is a less cpu intencive algorithm, with not too big
compromise on compression ratio

`redundant_metadata=most` - will reduce the number of copies of the
indirect blocks at the higher levels. This can greatly cut the amount
of data that must be written, resulting in better performance.

Multiple tunabels to better regulate how fast ZFS can accept
requests. This along helped mediate maximum latency on parallel access
with small ARC:

```bash
zfs_vdev_async_write_active_min_dirty_percent = 10
zfs_vdev_async_write_active_max_dirty_percent = 30
zfs_delay_min_dirty_percent = 40
zfs_delay_scale = 800000
zfs_dirty_data_max = 50% of zfs_arc_max
zfs_dirty_data_sync_percent = 15
```

### Minimum supported system requirements

Minimum supported system requirements to install ZFS storage is 64GB memory and 3 physical disks set in eve_persist_disk.
eve_install_skip_zfs_checks should be set in installation config to override the requirement check for experimental installs.
